# object-detection-with-keras-api-using-python
This repo contains 2 Python files for testing Keras models using TensorFlow. Other creates a simple model for classifying using cifar10 dataset.


THIS TEST MODEL DOESNT WORK EVERYWHERE. YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE Cifar-10 DATASET IN YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE AND ENTER YOUR FILE PATH FOR THE DATASET.


THE SAVING AFTER TRAINING IS DONE BY CREATING A  '.H5' FILE IN GOOGLE DRIVE AND THEN LINKING THE FILE WHERE I PUT MY LOCATION.

IN THE TRAINING MODEL I HAVE GIVEN MANY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE WORKING OF EACH SYNTAX.

THE CODE OUTPUT IS SHOWN FOR ONE EPOCH BUT I HAVE MODIFIED THE CODE TO 35 EPOCHS BEFORE UPLOADING TO GIT HUB. SO BE SURE TO INCREASE UPTO 50 EPOCHS  OR RUN MINIMUM 35 EPOCHS FOR BETTER ACCURACY.

REGARDING THE TEST FILE IT IS YOUR IMAGINATION ON WHAT DATAS YOU NEED AS OUTPUTS. AGAIN YOU GUJYS HAVE TO RUN THE FILE USING THE CORRECT (.H5)FILE WHICH YOU HAVE SAVE THE TRAINED WEGHTS IN OR IT WONT WORK.

IF THE CODE CAN BE OPTIMISED STILL PLEASE BE SURE TO PUT A PULL REQUEST.
